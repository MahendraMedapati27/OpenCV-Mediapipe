# OpenCV-MediaPipe Projects

Welcome to the OpenCV-MediaPipe repository! This repository contains projects showcasing the integration of OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time computer vision applications, with a focus on hand gesture recognition and control of LEDs and servos and many other projects.

## About MediaPipe

MediaPipe is an open-source framework developed by Google that provides a comprehensive solution for building real-time machine learning pipelines. It offers a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for processing audio, video, and sensor data. MediaPipe's modular architecture enables developers to easily construct complex pipelines tailored to their specific use cases.

## Projects

### Hand Gesture Recognition

This project demonstrates how to use MediaPipe's hand tracking module in conjunction with OpenCV to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time. By analyzing the landmarks detected on the hand, the system can interpret gestures such as open palm, closed fist, thumbs up, and more.

### LED Control with Hand Gestures

In this project, hand gestures detected by the system are used to control LEDs connected to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino). By mapping specific gestures to predefined actions, users can interact with the physical world using intuitive hand movements.

### Servo Control with Hand Poses

Using MediaPipe's pose estimation module, this project tracks the position and orientation of the hand in space. By correlating hand poses with servo motor movements, the system enables users to manipulate physical objects or robotic systems with natural hand gestures.
